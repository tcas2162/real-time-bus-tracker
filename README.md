# real-time-bus-tracker
 This is an animation that displays a city bus location in real-time. When you click on the button in the upper left hand corner, a visualization of all of the stops from my neighborhood to the local mall are shown. Building upon the previous example shown in class, I have created a custom button style, which shows a faded button that displays at full opacity after a 0.2 second hover and/or click on the button. In the future, I would like to experiment with labeling the different stops for clarification and a better user experience.
